# PersonalWADEdits
Occasionally I'll come across a WAD that I really enjoy. Rarely will I ever find any such WAD which is compatible with every map/gameplay mod I'd like it to be. So I'm intending for this to serve as a way for me to organize various edits to WADs I like in an effort to generalize them for my own personal use cases.
