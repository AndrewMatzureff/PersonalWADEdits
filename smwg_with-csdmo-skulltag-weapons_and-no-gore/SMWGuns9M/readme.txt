SMOOTHWEAPS for Doom, Heretic, Chex Quest

LATEST VERSION: Chex and Heretic compatibility, Blue Plasma Coil, Shorty Shotgun, RPK

2nd UPDATE:

New pistol, better than the old.
Pistol and Tommy Gun now use the TEXTURES lump to scale their sprites from a 4:3 ratio source. A bit extra vertical detail is the result, and they now look good on 320x240.
Added in the chainsaw pickup sprite for the Wolverine claws, so you can at least find them.

UPDATE: Wolverine claws replace chainsaw
Tommy gun replaces chaingun


By Phi108

High quality, high framerate, true color model rip replacements for pistol, shotgun, rocketlauncher, plasmarifle, including the boxing fists from Immoral Conduct doom.

Works in ZDoom and GZDoom. Weapons are displayed in true color in GZDoom, but I get better performance with ZDoom.
